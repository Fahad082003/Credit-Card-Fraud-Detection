🚨🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection – Accuracy Up to 99.77%! 🔍🚨
Just wrapped up a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world data.

🧠 Models Used & Results:
🌲 Random Forest – 99.77%
🌿 Decision Tree – 99.44%
🧮 Logistic Regression & SVM – ~92%

⚖️ Challenge: Highly imbalanced dataset (more non-fraud than fraud cases).
✅ Solution: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the classes and improve model performance.

📊 Highlights:
Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
Balanced learning with SMOTE
Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Clean Jupyter Notebook workflow

💡 This project shows how combining the right models with data preprocessing techniques like SMOTE can fight financial fraud effectively.
